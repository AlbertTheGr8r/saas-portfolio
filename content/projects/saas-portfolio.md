# SaaS Portfolio Template

A modern, responsive portfolio template designed with neobrutalism aesthetics. The original template was lifted from [Neobrutalism Templates](https://github.com/neobrutalism-templates/saas). It's gone as of this writing, but I'm keeping it here for reference.

## Features

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Dark mode support
- Static export for GitHub Pages
- Contentlayer for blog/projects

## Tech Stack

I'm using this as a learning project to familiarize myself with modern web development. I'm also using it as a portfolio template for my own projects.

- **Next.js** - React framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **shadcn/ui** - Component library
- **Contentlayer** - Content management

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run dev server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build
```

The project is optimized for static export and can be deployed to GitHub Pages or any static hosting provider. If things go well, the push should run the build.
