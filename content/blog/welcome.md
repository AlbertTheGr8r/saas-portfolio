# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using **Contentlayer** and **MDX** to build a fully static site. No backend required since that's what a static site is.

## Why Static?

Static sites are:
- Fast (pre-rendered HTML)
- Secure (no server to hack)
- Cheap to host (GitHub Pages is free)
- Easy to version control (everything is in git)

## Code Example

Here's some TypeScript code:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

console.log(greet('World'))
```

Seeing color? Eyy, welcome from the future. As of posting it's not yet implemented.

## Lists

Here's what I'm using:

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Contentlayer for content management
- MDX for rich content
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- [Neobrutalism design system](https://www.neobrutalism.dev/)

## Links

Another aspect of this project is [projects](/projects), or go back [home](/).
